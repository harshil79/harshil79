# 👋 Hello, I'm Harshil Mistry

Welcome to my GitHub! Highly enthusiastic about AI, I'm a beginner with a hunger for learning. 
Eager to dive into AI, ML and computer vision, recognizing their potential to revolutionize industries. 
A team player with strong leadership and communication skills, 
Ready to contribute to innovative projects in the dynamic realms of ML, AI and computer vision. 

## 📚 Currently Pursuing 
- **MSc. Digital Engineering** at Bauhaus University, Weimar

## 🚀 Featured Projects
### Project 1: AI ASSISTED ARGUMENTATIVE WRITING
• This project basically includes fine tuning a Large language model,
through the integration of an argumentative knowledge graph to aid the LLM in aauto generating arguments. 
The model will subsequently provide counterarguments, or supporting proofs by availing 2 to 3 alternative options.
• It also includes implementation of deep learning models utilizing PyTorch, Neo4J, transformers and the HuggingFace libraries, 
leading to enhanced model performance and accuracy.
• Additionally employing Docker to train models on a distributed computing platform via SLURM, resulting in increased efficiency and
scalability.
